 List Pagination and Filtering
by Christine Treacy
Aiming for Exceeds Expectations

//Project description//
The goal of this project was to create a searchable list of students, 
paginate through the results and return a message to the user if no results were found.

//Project techniques//
This project had many components learned throughout unit 2
They included: dynamically adding elements to the page, 
adding attributes to those elements, targetting elements in the DOM, 
creating functions, creating for loops and if statements to search through
each student in the list or each page in the document. I also worked on traversing
the DOM to append elements to their correct locations. Event listeners were 
utilized for click and keyup events.

//Extra credit features//
I added the search feature to the page-header div which allows users
to search for a specific student name. The keyup feature I added will
search as the user is typing instead of just when the 'Search' button is clicked.
The pagination links also display according to how many record results were found.
A 'No results found' h2 displays when the search does not return an results.
